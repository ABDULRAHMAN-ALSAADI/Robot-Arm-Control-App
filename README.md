# 🤖 Robot Arm Control App

Welcome to the Robot Arm Control System! This app allows you to control a robotic arm easily using a modern Flutter UI and ESP32 through a local server powered by XAMPP and SQL. Whether you're testing or performing tasks like pick & place, this system helps you control your robot with precision and ease. 💡

## 📱 Features

- 🎛️ Manual Motor Control – Use sliders to control up to 6 motors, each with angle values (0° to 180°).

- 💾 Save & Run Moves – Save different robot positions like "Pick Object" or "Drop Position" and run them anytime.

- 🌐 ESP32 Communication – The app connects to ESP32 using:

-- get_run_pose ➡️ Sends the selected pose to the robot and starts execution.

-- update_statue 🔴 Updates the robot status as "Stopped".

- 📶 Wi-Fi Connectivity – Communicates over your local Wi-Fi network via XAMPP and SQL.
