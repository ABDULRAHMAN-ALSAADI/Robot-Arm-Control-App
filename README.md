# 🤖 Robot Arm Control App

Welcome to the Robot Arm Control System! This app allows you to control a robotic arm easily using a modern Flutter UI and ESP32 through a local server powered by XAMPP and SQL. Whether you're testing or performing tasks like pick & place, this system helps you control your robot with precision and ease. 💡

## 📱 Features

-- get_run_pose ➡️ Sends the selected pose to the robot and starts execution.

-- update_statue 🔴 Updates the robot status as "Stopped".
